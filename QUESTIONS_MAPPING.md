## Expected Response Quality

### Example High-Quality Responses:

**Q6: Service Type**
> "Service: Intermodal rail-road. Freight travels by rail for long-haul segment (e.g., Rotterdam to Munich), then switches to FTL truck for first mile pickup and last mile delivery to customer facilities. Reduces transport costs by ~20% and CO2 emissions by ~30% compared to full road transport. Transit time: Rail 36-48h + Road 4-8h = Total 40-56h."

**Q11: Reefer Requirements**
> "Reefer required: Yes. Temperature range: +2°C to +8°C for fresh chocolate products (Barry Callebaut contract). Multi-temperature capability: -18°C frozen ingredients section + +4°C finished goods section in same trailer. Pre-cooling: 2 hours before loading. Temperature monitoring: GPS tracker with real-time alerts for deviations >±2°C."

**Q19: KPI Summary**
> "KPIs for Prysmian contract:
> - OTD: Target 97%, Minimum 95% (FTL) / 93% (LTL)
> - Claims: Maximum 0.20% of shipments
> - Tender acceptance: 98% (min)
> - Penalties: €75 per rejected FTL booking, €25 per rejected LTL booking above 2% threshold
> - Demurrage: Included in waiting charges (€35/hour after free time)
> - Contract termination: 6 consecutive months below minimum triggers review and potential termination"

**Q21-23: FSC Complete Answer**
> "FSC requirements (Barry Callebaut):
> - Base fuel rate: €1.40/liter (diesel, EU average)
> - Fuel effect ratio: 30% (fuel represents 30% of operating costs)
> - FSC calculation: 25-30% surcharge applied when market fuel price exceeds €1.40 baseline
> - Adjustment frequency: Monthly, based on EU fuel price index
> - Example: If diesel rises to €1.68/liter (+20%), FSC increases by 20% × 30% effect ratio = +6% total rate"
