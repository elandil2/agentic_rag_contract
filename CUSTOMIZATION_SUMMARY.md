## Logistics & Transportation Contract Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## Overview
The RAG contract analysis system has been successfully customized from a general-purpose contract analyzer to a specialized **logistics and transportation contract analysis system**, optimized for FTL (Full Truck Load) and LTL (Less Than Truck Load) operations.

## Key Customizations

### 1. System Prompts Updated (config.py)

#### ‚úÖ RETRIEVER_PROMPT
**Purpose:** Optimized for logistics-specific information retrieval

**Key Features:**
- Prioritizes FTL/LTL rates, fuel surcharge, KPIs, OTD, transit times, equipment types
- Focuses on pricing structure, payment terms, penalties, operational requirements
- Identifies customer-specific rules (Tesla, Barry Callebaut, Prysmian, Carlsberg)
- Retrieves 2-3 most relevant passages with contract references

**Specialized Terms:**
- **Pricing:** FTL/LTL rates, fuel surcharge (%), waiting time charges, multi-stop fees, drop charges, demurrage
- **KPIs:** OTD (On-Time Delivery %), booking acceptance %, claims rate %, POD upload %
- **Operations:** Transit time, equipment type (thermo/ambient trailer), loading/unloading windows
- **Compliance:** CMR documents, POD (Proof of Delivery), export documents, SHP numbers
- **Penalties:** Late delivery fees, booking rejection charges, KPI failure consequences, chargeback %
- **Sustainability:** CO2 tracking, alternative fuels, environmental certifications

#### ‚úÖ ANALYST_PROMPT
**Purpose:** Logistics contract analyst specializing in FTL/LTL transportation agreements

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Customer-specific answers** - Always mentions which customer (Tesla, Barry Callebaut, Prysmian, Carlsberg)
2. **Exact numbers** - Includes rates (‚Ç¨/km, ‚Ç¨/shipment), percentages (fuel %, KPI targets), timeframes (hours, days)
3. **Contract section references** - Includes clause numbers when available
4. **Concise responses** - Answers ONLY what was asked

**Format Guidelines:**
- **Rates:** "Base rate: ‚Ç¨X/km + Fuel surcharge: X% (baseline ‚Ç¨Y/liter) + Waiting: ‚Ç¨Z/hour after 2h free"
- **KPIs:** "OTD target: X%, Minimum: Y%. Claims: <Z%. Booking acceptance: X%. POD upload: X% within 48h"
- **Transit times:** "Standard: X hours. Express: Y hours. Booking lead time: 2-7 days advance"
- **Payment:** "Net X days from invoice date. Deductions: Y% for non-compliance"
- **Penalties:** "‚Ç¨X per failed delivery OR Y% chargeback. Sustained failure: Lane reassignment/contract termination"
- **Equipment:** "Thermo trailers (Nov-Mar), Ambient trailers (Apr-Oct). Seasonal rate adjustment: ¬±X%"

#### ‚úÖ SUPERVISOR_PROMPT
**Purpose:** Manages logistics and transportation contract analysis workflow

**Responsibilities:**
1. Identifies query type: Rate inquiry, KPI requirement, penalty clause, operational rule, payment terms, or general summary
2. Delegates to retriever first (always retrieve before analysis)

   - Contract overviews or summaries ‚Üí Summarizer
4. Identifies customer context (Tesla, Barry Callebaut, Prysmian, Carlsberg, etc.)
5. Ensures responses include exact figures, percentages, and timeframes

**Common Query Patterns:**
- "What is the [rate/KPI/penalty] for [customer]?" ‚Üí Retriever ‚Üí Analyst
- "Summarize the [customer] contract" ‚Üí Retriever ‚Üí Summarizer
- "What happens if [KPI/condition] is not met?" ‚Üí Retriever ‚Üí Analyst (focus on penalties)
- "What are the payment terms?" ‚Üí Retriever ‚Üí Analyst
- "Compare [aspect] between customers" ‚Üí Multiple retrievals ‚Üí Analyst

#### ‚úÖ SUMMARIZER_PROMPT
**Purpose:** Creates logistics-focused contract summaries

**Summary Structure:**
1. **Contract Overview:** Customer name, contract period, scope (lanes/routes), volume estimates
2. **Pricing Structure:** Base FTL/LTL rates, fuel surcharge, additional charges, seasonal adjustments
3. **KPI Requirements:** OTD target %, Claims rate %, Booking acceptance %, POD upload compliance
4. **Operational Requirements:** Transit time standards, equipment type, loading/unloading procedures, booking lead time
5. **Penalties & Consequences:** Late delivery fees, KPI failure penalties, contract termination conditions
6. **Payment Terms:** Net payment days, invoice requirements
7. **Compliance & Sustainability:** CMR, POD, CO2 tracking, certifications
